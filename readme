To compile I simply used

gcc -g morse.c -o morse

for some reason the stock make file from flash would not work for me so I opted out to just using the command

and to run the code

./morse "A string of words to be turned into morse code"

I designed my code to use a switch statement within a while loop for all letters in order to save complexity and time
with just using a bunch of if, if else, else statments. The reason I used a while loop is because the while loop will continue running untill it hits the null pointer of the array of characters allowing me to input any length of a word.

I from there created 4 classes to implement the code:

gpioW() 	this writes a value of 0 or 1 to the GPIO pin
inletter()	sleeps the code for the according time when off interval inside a letter is needed.
dot() 		turns the light on and sleeps for the dot on time.
dash() 		turns the light off and sleeps for the time off time.

This removed the repetiveness of typing out all the commands for turning on and off the light and sleeping.
